This repository contains my implementations codes of deep generative model course, includes :

* [Developing VAE, Beta-VAE, CVAE(conditional VAE) and conducting experiments on them.](https://github.com/niiiikou/DeepGenerativeModels/tree/main/HW2)

* [Implementing score matching for training diffusion models.](https://github.com/niiiikou/DeepGenerativeModels/tree/main/HW3)

* [Presenting causalvae paper in final project and reproduce experiments of it.](https://github.com/niiiikou/DeepGenerativeModels/tree/main/FinalProject)
